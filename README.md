# 🛠️ Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling - Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4, Episode 7) 🔮

## **Objective** 🎯

The objective of this competition is to predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer. Accurate predictions can help insurance companies efficiently target potential customers, improving their marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## **Evaluation** 📊

Submissions will be evaluated based on the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) metric. This metric measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative responses, with higher scores indicating better performance.
