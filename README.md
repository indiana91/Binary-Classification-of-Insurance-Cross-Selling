# üõ†Ô∏è Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling - Kaggle Playground Series (Season 4, Episode 7) üîÆ

## **Objective** üéØ

The objective of this competition is to predict which customers respond positively to an automobile insurance offer. Accurate predictions can help insurance companies efficiently target potential customers, improving their marketing strategies and customer engagement.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Built With

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [LightGBM](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Dataset üì¶

The dataset provided for this competition includes various features related to customer demographics, vehicle information, and previous insurance history. Participants will use this data to build and train binary classification models, aiming to accurately predict the likelihood of a customer responding positively to the insurance offer.

**Explore the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7/data), develop your machine learning models, and submit your predictions through the Kaggle [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e7/overview) platform before the deadline.**

## Files üìÑ

- **train.csv**: Training dataset containing abalone measurements and their corresponding ages.
- **test.csv**: Test dataset for which you need to predict the abalone ages.
- **sample_submission.csv**: A sample submission file demonstrating the correct format for predictions.

## **Evaluation** üìä

Submissions will be evaluated based on the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) metric. This metric measures the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative responses, with higher scores indicating better performance.

## üìù Conclusion

In this project, we worked on the Binary Classification of Insurance Cross Selling dataset. Our goal was to predict customer responses to an automobile insurance offer. We started by preprocessing the data and performing exploratory data analysis. Then, we trained XGBoost and LightGBM models to make predictions. We evaluated the models using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC) metric. Finally, we submitted our predictions to the Kaggle competition.

To visualize our results, we have two submission images. The first image, labeled as `XGBoost Model`, shows the performance of our XGBoost model. The second image, labeled as `LightGBM Model`, shows the performance of our LightGBM model. Both images have been resized for better viewing.
